### Project Overview
- I built this progressive web app as a part of FEND with Udacity. 
- This web page is responsive and works perfectly even when offline, because it uses a ServiceWorker.
- It's a restaurant reviews app

### Running the web page
- To have full access to the application, clone the repo and experiment with it.
- You can run it locally using the command `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then visit `localhost:8000`.
